#GIT Paid - A CLI application for finding your next Dev job
#GIT Paid interacts with the GITHUB Jobs API which houses hundreds of worldwide Developer job openings

#Overview: Project Vision
As-pitched, we wanted to create an application that interacts with an API and includes the following functionality:

1. Job Hunters should be able to search for all jobs by name
2. Job Hunters should be able to search for jobs by location
3. Job Hunters should be able to search for jobs by technology
4. Job Hunters should be able to favorite jobs and save them to a list
5. Job Hunters should be able to browse favorited jobs
6. Job Hunters should be able to apply for a job

#Populating the Database
1. Open your terminal and navigate to the correct application folder where you cloned the repository
2. Run 'bundle install' to make sure you have all the necessary gems
3. Run 'rake db:migrate' to create database tables
4. Run 'rake db:seed' to populate database tables with data gathered from the GITHUB Jobs API

#Running the App
1. Run 'ruby bin/run.rb' in your terminal to open GIT Paid
2. Once open, you'll be greeted with a main menu. Follow the on-screens to navigate

2. Search For Jobs: Allows Job Hunters to search GITHUB Jobs API by current user location, any location, title and technology
